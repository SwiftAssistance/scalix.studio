At this price point you should expect a clean, mobile-responsive design with 3-5 pages, basic SEO setup, contact forms, and fast loading speeds. At Scalix Studios, our Starter package begins at £299 and includes all of this plus a content management system so you can make updates yourself.' },
      { type: 'h3', text: 'Growth Websites: £1,000 – £4,999' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'For businesses that need more functionality — think booking systems, e-commerce with up to 50 products, custom integrations, or a blog. The design work is more bespoke, with custom graphics, animations, and a UX strategy tailored to your customer journey. Our Growth package at £499 sits at the affordable end of this range while still delivering premium results.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'Large e-commerce stores, membership platforms, custom web applications, and complex integrations. At this level you\'re paying for significant custom development work, extensive testing, and ongoing support.' },

Professional websites are built around conversion — guiding visitors toward calling you, filling in a form, or making a purchase. That strategic design thinking is what you\'re really paying for.' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'SEO doesn\'t have to be complicated. While the technical details can get deep, the fundamentals that drive results for small businesses are straightforward. Here are 10 tips that actually work in 2026.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '1. Claim and Optimise Your Google Business Profile' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'This is the single most impactful thing you can do for local SEO. Your Google Business Profile (formerly Google My Business) is what shows up in the map pack when someone searches "plumber near me" or "accountant in Slough." Fill out every field: business hours, services, photos, and encourage happy customers to leave reviews.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '2. Target Local Keywords' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Don\'t try to rank for "accountant" nationally. Focus on "accountant in Slough" or "accountants near Windsor." These local keywords have less competition and the people searching them are ready to buy. Use them in your page titles, headings, and naturally throughout your content.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '3. Make Your Website Mobile-First' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Over 60% of searches happen on mobile. Google uses mobile-first indexing, which means it primarily uses the mobile version of your site for ranking. If your site is slow or hard to use on a phone, you\'re losing both rankings and customers.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '4. Speed Up Your Website' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Page speed is a ranking factor. Use Google PageSpeed Insights to test your site. Compress images, enable caching, and choose a fast hosting provider. Most users will leave a site that takes more than 3 seconds to load.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '5. Create Useful Content Regularly' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'A blog isn\'t just for fun — it\'s a powerful SEO tool. Each blog post is a new page that can rank for different keywords. Write about topics your customers actually search for: "how much does a new fence cost?" or "do I need an accountant for my small business?"' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '6. Get Your NAP Consistent' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'NAP stands for Name, Address, Phone number. Make sure these are identical across your website, Google Business Profile, social media, and every directory listing. Inconsistencies confuse Google and hurt your local rankings.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '7. Build Local Citations' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'List your business on relevant local directories: Yell, Thomson Local, Yelp, industry-specific directories, and your local Chamber of Commerce. These citations help Google verify your business and improve your local authority.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '8. Use Internal Linking' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Link between your own pages. Your homepage should link to your services, your services should link to relevant blog posts, and your blog posts should link back to your services. This helps Google understand your site structure and passes authority between pages.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '9. Optimise Your Title Tags and Meta Descriptions' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'These are the first things people see in Google results. Your title tag should include your target keyword and be under 60 characters. Your meta description should be compelling and under 160 characters. Think of them as your ad copy for organic search.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: '10. Track Everything' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Set up Google Analytics and Google Search Console (both are free). Track which keywords are driving traffic, which pages are performing best, and where people are dropping off. You can\'t improve what you don\'t measure.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'The Bottom Line' },

      { type: 'p', text: 'SEO is the long game. Once you\'re ranking on page 1, that traffic is essentially free. We have clients who invested in SEO 12 months ago and are now generating hundreds of leads per month without spending a penny on ads.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'The Cost Comparison' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'Google Ads: You pay per click, typically £1-10 per click depending on your industry. A modest campaign might cost £300-500/month in ad spend plus management fees. The cost is ongoing — stop paying, stop getting traffic.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'SEO: Monthly investment typically starts from £149/month. Results take longer but the traffic you generate is free. After 6-12 months, your cost per lead from SEO is usually a fraction of what you\'d pay through ads.' },
      { type: 'h2', text: 'Our Recommendation: Use Both' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'The most successful strategy we\'ve seen is to run both simultaneously. Use Google Ads for immediate leads while your SEO builds momentum. As your organic rankings improve, you can gradually reduce ad spend and shift budget to SEO. This gives you both short-term results and long-term growth.' },
      { type: 'p', text: 'We call this the "bridge strategy" — PPC bridges the gap while SEO catches up, then SEO becomes your primary lead source with PPC used strategically for peak periods and competitive terms.' },
